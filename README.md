# COVID-19-Genomics-Analysis-Project
The project is created based on the lessons from the Wellcome Connecting Science course on Bioinformatics.

## Scripts
1. The first script outlines a pipeline designed for processing a single sample.
2. The second script extends the pipeline to accommodate the processing of two samples.
3. The Nextflow script orchestrates a pipeline capable of processing multiple samples concurrently.
